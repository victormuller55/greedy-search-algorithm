# Greedy Search Algorithm

The Greedy Search Algorithm, implemented in Python, is a solution developed for academic purposes. This algorithm follows the greedy approach, aiming to solve problems by making locally optimal choices at each stage, with the aspiration of achieving a globally optimal solution.

## About:
The Greedy Search Algorithm is a technique used in algorithm design to address optimization problems. By selecting the best available option at each step, the algorithm aims to reach the optimal solution for the given problem.

## Key Features:
- Optimization: The algorithm aims to find the best possible solution by selecting locally optimal choices.
- Simplicity: Implemented in Python, the algorithm is designed to be easy to understand and modify.
- Scalability: While the greedy approach may not always yield the globally optimal solution, it is often efficient and scalable for certain types of problems.
